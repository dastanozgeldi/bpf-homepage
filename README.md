# BPF CLUB

## WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

bpf.vodka is the digital temple of the most toxic dev chat on Telegram. We built this because we can, and to prove that your "modern web stack" is fucking garbage.

## MISSION STATEMENT
- Show normies what REAL performance looks like
- Prove that your "optimized" website is bloated trash
- Create something so based it makes /g/ look like Stack Overflow

## FLEX WALL OF SHAME (aka "todo")

### PHASE 0: CHAT SUPREMACY
- [ ] Member's Project Execution Chamber
  - Auto-scrape GitHub/GitLab profiles
  - Calculate toxicity score based on commit messages
  - Memory leak wall of shame
  - "Time since last `any`" counter per member
  - Project performance metrics that'll make you cry
  - Bundle size comparison (with public execution)
  - Runtime performance graphs that'll end careers
  - Auto-generate roasts based on code quality
  - Realtime "most based dev" leaderboard
  - Integration with Telegram for instant humiliation

Why? Because we fucking can. While you're busy writing Medium articles about your "optimized React app", we're actually building shit that works. This isn't your typical "showcase website" - it's a monument to everything wrong with modern web development, built by people who actually understand how computers work.

We're not moving our chat here because:
1. Your WebSocket implementation is garbage
2. Your "real-time" is a joke
3. Your "optimized" bundle is larger than the entire Linux kernel
4. Telegram's already perfect for our toxicity needs

This is just our temple of judgment, where we expose the sins of modern web development and show what happens when people who actually understand computers decide to flex on web dev tourists.

## THE ACTUAL FUCKING PLAN

### PHASE 1: FLEX ON PLEBS
- [ ] Member Wall of Pain
  - Git blame wall exposing everyone's crimes
  - Performance metrics of personal projects
  - Auto-generated roasts based on commit history
  - Public shaming for using `any` type
  - Realtime "days since last memory leak" counter

### PHASE 2: KNOWLEDGE TEMPLE
- [ ] Tech Manifesto
  - Why your favorite framework is trash
  - How to write actual performant code
  - Advanced TypeScript dark arts
  - Kernel optimization black magic
  - Memory management for brainlets

### PHASE 3: BASED CONTENT
- [ ] Blog of Truth
  - Weekly roasts of popular GitHub repos
  - Performance war crimes exposed
  - TypeScript type puzzles that'll make you cry
  - Real debugging stories (normies won't understand)
  - How we optimized X to death

### PHASE 4: TOOLS OF DESTRUCTION
- [ ] Performance Benchmark Arena
  - Upload your site, get brutally roasted
  - Real-time memory leak detection
  - Bundle size comparison (with public shaming)
  - CPU profile analysis that'll make you quit
  - Network waterfall of shame

### PHASE 5: COMMUNITY WARFARE
- [ ] Battle Arena
  - Weekly code challenges (leetcode is for babies)
  - Real-world performance optimization battles
  - Type system gladiator fights
  - Memory leak hunting competitions
  - Algorithm complexity wars

Remember: We're not here to help. We're here to show what happens when actual developers get tired of your "good enough" bullshit.
